The Word Guess Game picks a word from a predetermined list, at random, for the user to guess. The user inputs guesses one letter at a time via key press. The game is essentially similar to Hangman.

The game accepts user input in the form of key press of any alphabet character (a-z). Special characters and numbers are ignored (as well as letters outside the Latin alphabet of a-z). It will display how many guesses are remaining, which letters have already been guessed, and it will display the correct letters filled in as they are provided.
